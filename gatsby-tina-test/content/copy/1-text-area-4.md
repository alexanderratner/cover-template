Those unfamiliar with K-pop may not realize it, but most idols don’t have a JB level of autonomy over their look. Most of the time, they’re willing canvases. JB is more discerning, veering his aesthetic more toward edgy and dark instead of the typical glittery and bright. Nothing is wrong with the later, JB says. Rather, he prefers to provide alternate representations of what a male K-pop star looks like. Growing out his hair helped him do exactly that.

**&nbsp**  

“I wanted to get out of that box of K-Pop style,” JB tells me. “When you look at pictures of other guys, they usually have the same stereotypical two-block hairstyle \[K-pop’s take on an undercut\]. Because it’s part of our jobs as idols to look impressive, I wanted something different — a new look with more texture. This is my own way of expressing that.”

**&nbsp**  

And the gradient of onyx, crimson, and cocoa often seamlessly blended onto his lids and the foundation evening out his complexion and giving it a glow is just for JB, he notes. When he isn’t working, JB hardly puts anything on his skin. Even when his skin is breaking out, he skips moisturizer because he believes drying out his skin helps clear it up. I wince at this revelation, and he quickly adds in English, “That’s only my tip, only for me.”

**&nbsp**  

Piercings are another way for JB to experiment with boundaries. In October 2019, he got a stud in his nose. Three months later, fans were shocked when they discovered a picture on Instagram of him with an anti-eyebrow piercing, which was basically a barbell placed underneath the skin atop his cheekbone that looked like two studs below his eye. One of his friends, who has one dermal stud in the same area, inspired the unexpected placement, he tells me.

**&nbsp**  

He did both on a whim, but they have thoughtful implications. “I wanted to show people that piercings aren’t a bad thing or good thing, but it’s a new cultural thing,” he notes, referencing the changing mindsets Koreans have about tattoos and facial piercings as accessories more than gang affiliations like they did in the past. Although piercing is legal in South Korea (unlike tattooing), getting them on anything other than your ear still makes many cringe. But that’s no different than part of America. I tell him my parents freaked out when I pierced my septum. “Same,” JB says. (K-pop stars: They’re just like us.) “But I wanted it, so I got it. It's my body and my life. So I just did it.”

**&nbsp**  

“Do you feel like getting piercings gives you more control over yourself?” I ask.

**&nbsp**  

“Yes, I get the feeling that I'm responsible for my life when I get piercings,” JB remarks.

**&nbsp**  

The subject of tattoos comes up. “I want one, but I change my mind too often,” JB shares, releasing a long sigh. “I have thought about the design, but then I think ‘would this be better than this?’ Because of that, I haven’t been able to get one.”

**&nbsp**  

Because K-pop stars change up their concepts so often, the same aesthetic antsiness has seemed to trickle down into JB’s everyday life. He took out his anti-eyebrow piercing because he got tired of it. He recently dyed his hair petal pink just because. Although he hints during our interview that the hair color is a possibility, it’s unexpectedly vibrant for someone who has carved out a dark aesthetic for himself. For once, JB seems to be matching his multichromatic music.

**&nbsp**  

Over the past six years, JB has penned GOT7’s title tracks like “Eclipse” and “You Calling My Name.” He’s also written and composed beloved B-sides, like my personal favorites “Teenager” and “Page.” Each is more synthesia-inducing than the next. Under an alias, Def., JB also drops moody, meditative songs without his face attached to them on Soundcloud or with his crew of friends called Øffshore.

**&nbsp**  

Because JB is constantly making music — for GOT7, for Def, for Øffshore — I wonder aloud how he has anything left when he’s giving so much of his creativity to others. JB doesn’t make music when he feels unmotivated, he reveals. Instead, “I rest, write for myself, draw, or walk around town,” he adds. He’s even taken up painting. And if JB ever loses steam on stage, “I put on both in-ears and turn up the volume,” he continues. “Then I kinda go crazy as if I’m at the karaoke and tell myself, ‘I’m having fun.”

**&nbsp**  

Looking down at the time on my recorder, I notice our time together is running out. If his manager had it his way, we would have been done 30 minutes ago. When he wanted me to wrap up the interview then, JB cordially reassured him we were OK to continue.

**&nbsp**  

“Are there things that you want for yourself in the future?” I decide to ask.

**&nbsp**  

JB thinks for a second. “How far into the future?”

**&nbsp**  

“How far can you see?” I return.

**&nbsp**  

Although he’s a big picture person, JB says he hasn’t given the future much thought. “I just want to do what I want to do and keep constantly working,” he adds. “I tend to have a big disappointment if I get greedy and have expectations.”
