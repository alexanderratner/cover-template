JB whips around, improvising choreography putting the fringe hanging around his neck in motion. Every step, strike, and spin is as explosively executed as in his performances, as though JB has a crush on each member of the audience, anyone who sees these photos, and wants to impress them all.

“I think JB is an idol and a superstar,” he later tells me, making me recall this magnetic moment. “I don’t know if I can say this or not, but I make up my mind that I’m a special person. On stage, I’m the best version of myself.”

At first, this brazen statement strikes me as weird coming from a guy who seemed didn’t want to be looked at when he arrived. It’s quite loud for someone with an ASMR-level of confidence. As soon as his hair is slicked back and sooty mauve eye shadow blankets his lids, though, Lim Jaebeom shifts into JB mode.

Weeks have passed since JB has been able to take the stage, and the next time is hard to say. GOT7 was scheduled to perform in Singapore two days before the shoot and head to Macau at the end of the week, but the remaining stops on their Keep Spinning world tour were either postponed or cancelled. Mounting concerns over COVID-19 cleared the K-pop group’s schedule, as well as my own. One of my last days working outside of my home was spent witnessing JB in his element.

By the time we sit down in his dressing room for this interview, the rusted brown pigment rimming JB’s eyes 20 minutes earlier has been wiped away. He ran a hand through his hair. The street clothes are back on. His piercing gaze softens into warm eye contact, reflecting the bejeweled yellow smiley face charm hanging from his neck. He hugs his knees, feet tucked up on the makeup chair.

As he flows between speaking to me in Korean and English, I’m not sure if I’m talking to JB or Jaebeom. It’s like the thin layer of foundation remaining on his skin is making him glitch between the two. Sometimes, he’s frank, honest, and vulnerable as if we’re two friends catching up after a long day at work. Other times, he’s vague, evasive, and disarmingly optimistic in the way I’ve become familiar with when interviewing K-pop stars. These contradicting sides of himself have been warring within him since his debut in 2012.

“I’m usually the type to steer away from the typical ‘star’ character, but my job is to fulfill that,” JB admits. “So I contemplated a lot about ‘What should I do? What should I do?’ I came to think it would be interesting to show myself as a character, JB. I am myself, but I’m expressing one side of it.”

For a moment, I imagine JB cutting off a slice of himself to serve on a silver platter for public consumption.
