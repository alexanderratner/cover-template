This piece started being prepared in 2009. JB joined JYP Entertainment, one of K-pop’s leading entertainment companies, after tying for first with fellow GOT7 member Jinyoung in an open audition. After three years of intense training, JB was introduced to the world for the first time as not as a singer but as an actor playing an idol in K-drama Dream High 2 named...JB. Several months later, the role became a reality when he officially debuted as half of K-pop duo JJ Project, complete with blonde hair with a middle-school emo phase haircut and clip-on bangs in orange and fuchsia. (Jinyoung was the mohawked other half.) In 2014, he debuted once again — this time as the leader of GOT7. March 2019 marked his third debut with Jus2, which is a subunit with, well, just two members of GOT7, along with Yugeom.

With eight years of K-pop stardom under his belt, JB has sharpened exactly who JB is — and what he should look like. As of April 2020, he has chin-grazing hair, a nose piercing, and often wears one colored contact in blue or red. (If a remake of _10 Things I Hate About You_ came out right now, Patrick Verona would look exactly like him.)

No matter what tweaks he makes to his presentation, JB delicately weaves together conventional representations of masculinity and femininity — a hallmark of male K-pop stars that intrigues me most about the industry. JB, in particular, blurs the binary by pairing suits with smoky eyes; glossy raspberry lips with track jackets. JB verifies makeup and masculinity are far from mutually exclusive; indulging in classically feminine things don’t make you any less of a sex symbol/Internet boyfriend/object of fangirl’s affection. He’s just showing the world how he sees JB.

“More than thinking in two separate categories of masculine and feminine, I just express them in the way that feels like me, the things that I like,” he explains. “Of course, \[my definitions\] change from time to time. One time, I thought manicures were feminine, but now, I think they’re really cool. I respect guys who are getting them. I might try black, white, or gray \[polish\] one day. Also, when I was growing my hair out, at first, I thought I would look feminine. Then, I realized there’s no masculine or feminine way of doing things. And after trying it out, I felt like the look is just like me in my own style.”

How would _you_ describe your style, though, I inquire. He sighs, drawing out the words JB’s style as he ponders my question. He finally says he hasn’t thought about it in detail.

However, JB seems to subconsciously have an almost astrological set of defining traits for the idol character he’s created: sleek, stubborn, disciplined, and sharp. His actions on camera, his outfits, his hair and makeup should perpetually portray these characteristics. Thinking of him in these defined terms is easy because K-pop stars are often seen in confined situations. Their social media is strictly monitored. Their schedules are tight, limited to performances and TV appearances. You rarely see what they do in their free time because paparazzi don’t follow them in the way American celebrities experience. GOT7 fans will tell you JB’s no-nonsense, stoic, loyal, and assertive.

According to the stars, Lim Jaebeom is a Capricorn: ambitious, practical, generous, and patient. (After spending the day with him, I’m certain he fits the bill. I’d also add witty and empathetic.) He was born on January 6, 1994 in a city just outside of Seoul, South Korea. When JB closes his eyes, he can’t imagine at any point thinking he’d ever be where he is now, like doing his photo shoot for a U.S. magazine, going to the farthest cities from Seoul on world tours with a chart-topping septet, and winning major awards along the way. He was simply a kid who knew he wanted to sing, dance, and compose songs for as long as possible.

“I’m surprised so many people like us,” he says in English so sheepishly that I know he genuinely means it and it’s just being a humble idol. “I feel so nervous and happy. So many feelings come to my heart.”
