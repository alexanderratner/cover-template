Through a pair of tinted glass doors, my eyes inadvertently fall on a young man descending the slate staircase, headed toward the photo studio I’m standing in. His unzipped camo-green down parka flows behind him, exposing his simple white tee and gray track pants underneath. A sudden silence falls over the photo studio as everyone else’s attention draws toward him.

He opens one of the doors and pads inside. I remain at a table 10 feet away while nearly a dozen people — producers, directors, stylists, assistants — rush over to greet him. With a soft smile, he leans his body forward, shaking hands with them all. When his tousled hair, middle-parted and raven black, falls into his face, he doesn’t pause to brush it away. It’s like his shield from the flock of attention. His low, even-keeled voice is easy to miss; each “hello” and “nice to meet you” is uttered in decibels just above a whisper. He never utters his name. Everyone knows it: JB.

As fast as he arrives, he disappears into his dressing room. Half an hour goes by. Our cover star reemerges in a seaweed-hued leather jacket and black leather pants. The photographer, Ahn Joo Young, snaps a quick test photo. As the flash goes off, the 26-year-old is instantly illuminated as JB — leader of internationally renowned K-pop group GOT7. The shoot begins.
